    "# Polygon Centroid and Area\n",
    "\n",
    "A polygon is an areal object: it has an area. But sometimes we tend to think of a polygon as a point. For example, while there are many ways to answer the questions of \"where is Columbus?\" one way to answer it is to say it is at 83 west and 40 north, which is liberally a point. In games, collisions between game objects can be determined using their center. People might also be interested in where is the geographic center of the conterminous U.S. Here, we call the center of a polygon its **centroid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to develop a reasonable way to estimate polygon centers. As we will see here, when we compute the center of a polygon, we also compute the area at the same time, not because of convenience (which is the case) but also necessity. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will be run on-the-fly in Google Colab. Because of that, it is necessary to load our geometry Python modules (such as point.py). The following line of code clones exactly the entire repository into the running environment of his notebook. Please note this is only needed to run in colab. To run the code in the tutorial in our own local computer using a Python interactive mode, we will use what we did before (i.e., downloading the necessary .py files from the github repo, and putting them in the right folder). There is no need to run this in local Python environment. This line should not be included in a Python program either."

There clearly is a problem of making the center using the average of the coordinates, as the values of the X and Y coordinates control where the point is. In our case above, the two points at the bottom pull the mean point down and outside the shape. If we add more points to the line at the bottom, the mean points will be pulled further down, which the shape remains the same. We would prefer a more reasonable way so that the coordinates do not have so expressive control over where the center should be. Instead, we want our center to be close toward the gravity or mass center of the shape. In the following code cell, we can plot a preferred point that is within the polygon."
