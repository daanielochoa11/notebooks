    "# Polygon Centroid and Area\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a combined version of some of the topics on polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent a polygon of $n$ points as $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2),...,(x_n,y_n),(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$, where we add an additional point in the sequence $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1,y_1)$ to ensure that the polygon is closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Polygon area\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust way to computing polygon area is to decompose the polygon into a set of **trapezoids**. Every line segment on the polygon boundary can form a trapezoid with the corresponding segment on the horizontal axis, as illustrated by the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/polygon-area-trapezoids.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We first get the sum of areas of all trapezoids formed by the upper line segments of the polygon. We then subtract this sum of areas by the sum of areas of the trapezoids formed by the lower lines. The following equation can then be used to compute the **polygon area** after decomposing it into a series of trapezoids. Note the order the points in the sequence is important and this is why we take the absolute value here.\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i+1} - x_i) (y_{i+1} + y_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygon areas can also be computed using the following cross-product form that can be derived using a triangulation procedure. We will just give this form here while more details can be found in an optional tutorial in this class. This is more convenient for calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual computation of areas, the result might be negative if the points are chained counterclockwise and we will need to take the absolute value of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polygon centroid\n",
    "\n",
    "The **centroid** of a polygon can be defined in various ways. However, it is common to think that the gravity center of the polygon is the centroid. If the boundaries of the polygon do not intersect, the centroid of the polygon is determined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = \\frac{1}{6A} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i + x_{i+1}) (x_i y_i - x_{i+1}y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\frac{1}{6A} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i + y_{i+1}) (x_i y_i - x_{i+1}y_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is the area of the polygon as calculated using the above formulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of similarity in calculating the centroid and the area of a polygon. This makes sense because we want the centroid to be close to the gravity center of the polygon. In other words, we weight the centroid by the areas. For this reason, we write one single function that does both. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "One important issue in the above algorithm is that we require the polygon to be closed. Otherwise, there will be errors. There are different ways to handle this. For example, we can simply return a `None` if the polygon is not closed. However, to make the code look more formal, we are going to tell Python that there is an error (in this way, we don't let errors go without being notified) and we want to stop running the code (because something important might just be dependent on the successful calculation of the area). This is what we call **to raise an error**. We will simply use a generic exception in Python to do this. In the following code, we will see the program stops after it prints 5 and then trows an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i, end=' ')\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        raise Exception('Just a test')\n",
    "        \n",
    "print('DONE')\n",
    "```\n"
   ]

    "It appears that when the exception is raised, the program will stop. But we can catch the exception and process it before we decide if we need to end the program or not. (For most of the cases, since we have caught the exception, we probably should know how to handle it and therefore it makes no sense to stop the program unless it is really necessary.)"
