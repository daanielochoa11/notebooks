    "# Point-in-Polygon: Even-odd Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Point-in-polygon is a crucial operation when we handle spatial data. For example, if we click on a polygon in QGIS, we want to quickly pull out the data about this polygon (instead of waiting for a while before the data shows up). There are many ways to determine whether a point is in a polygon and we introduce the even-odd algorithm here. To determine if a point (such as one of the dots in following figure) is in a polygon, we first draw a half line that starts from the point and points to the right of the point. If the half line intersects with the polygon in an odd number of times, then we say the point is in the polygon. Otherwise the point is outside the polygon. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/pip-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly simple algorithm, however, has many special cases that are tedious and must be addressed. For example, the half line *a* in the figure has a part of the polygon boundary on it and we will have to decide how many times the half lines intersects the polygon. Also, when a half line (e.g., *b* and *c*) goes through a vertex of the polygon, how many times should we count the intersection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next consideration is the calculation of intersection points. Computing the physical intersection point, if any, is an expensive process -- it takes some time to do and it takes a lot of times if we have a lot of intersection points to compute. To understand this, we should remember the so called polygon in GIS has many line segments and we will have to test whether each of the line segments intersects with the half line. That sounds a lot. But the good news is: we don't have to get the physical intersection point for most of the cases. For many cases, we just need to make a quick decision whether the half line intersects with the boundary. We can illustrate this using the following figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/pip-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure, it is clear that the half line (the one starts at point *A*) is not going to intersect with line segments *a*, *d*, and *e*. Line segment *c* crosses the half line, but we don't need to compute the intersection point --- we know for fact they will intersect because the two end points of *c* are on the different sides of the half line, and are to the right of point *A*. Taking out these cases, we only have one case left: line segments like *b* or *b'* where the two end points are on both sizes of the half line but one of the end point is to the left of point *A*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to consider a few **special cases**, when the point (dark dot below) is on one of the two ends of the line segment, or on a horizontal or vertical line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/point-in-polygon-special-cases.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are not going to discuss the details of calculating intersection of two line segments. Please refer to sections 2.5 and 2.6 in the *GIS Algorithms* book for those details. \n",
    "\n",

Now we randomly generate 100 points and count how many points are within the triangle. What is the proportion of the points within the triangle? This should give us an estimate of the area of the triangle. But this is just one estimation. If we do this again, we would get a different answer.
